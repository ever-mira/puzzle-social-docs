# AI

This page gives an overview about how AI could be used in later stages of the project.

## Overview

There could be an AI Chatbot on the social network or in the Chat. Depending on how much data we allow it to access, it could introduce people to each other, that it may think should meet, for whatever reason.

Supabase allows to integrate ChatGPT Plugins, that allow a specific ChatGPT instance to access data from the database:

## Cloudflare

Cloudflare allows to use all kinds of AI models (for example several open source AI models, or classification models):

## Classification Models

Classification models are for finding similarity in texts or pictures, to propose similar content to users.

## Other models

besides LLM's (large language models) and classification models, there are also models for TTS (text to speech) and STT (speech to text). A speech version of ChatGPT in a group chat would also be funny. As a shy person, this is far away for me.

## Next

Read the next chapter, to learn about independence (from providers), and about decentralization.
