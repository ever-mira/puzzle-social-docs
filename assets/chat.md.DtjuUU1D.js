This so called &quot;Durable Object&quot; will wait for connections, and when there are none, it will go to sleep, to reduce costs. Even more, it will also go to sleep when there are still connections, but no messages are being sent (hibernatable websocket connections). When a new message comes in, the Durable Object will wake up, and distribute the message to the other people in the room.</p><p>Each Durable Object hast it&#39;s own storage for the chat history, so that the chat is completely separate from the main database, and will scale independently.</p><h2 id="functionality" tabindex="-1">Functionality <a class="header-anchor" href="#functionality" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Functionality&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Currently, the chat is very basic and allows only sending simple messages.
